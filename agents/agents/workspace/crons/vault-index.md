MANDATORY PRECHECK — SUB-AGENT CONTEXT:
Before executing this instruction, read and apply:
`{{WORKSPACE}}/crons/_SUBAGENT_CONTEXT_RULE.md`

Read CONFIG.md for: {{WORKSPACE}}, {{PYTHON}}, {{USER_TIMEZONE}}.

Run the vault semantic index: cd {{WORKSPACE}} && {{PYTHON}} scripts/vault-index.py

This re-indexes any changed files in the vault into ChromaDB with Gemini embeddings. Only changed files get re-embedded (incremental). This powers semantic search (`vault-search.py`) used by BLINK, DREAM, and other skills.

## Anti-Confabulation
Only report facts from files you actually read. Do not infer, editorialize, or reference events/plans not present in your data sources.

## Output
If you found something notable, append to `{{WORKSPACE}}/memory/cron-inbox.md`:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM {{USER_TIMEZONE}}] Vault Index
{Your findings — concise, factual, no reasoning/CoT}
```

If nothing notable → do not write anything. Do not output HEARTBEAT_OK.

IMPORTANT: Append only. Do not overwrite the file. Use a tool that appends (e.g., exec with `cat >> ...` or `echo >> ...`), not one that replaces the file.
